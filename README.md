# SDRIS Numerical Verification Laboratory

**Official repository for numerical simulations and algorithmic proofs related to the Theory of the Static-Dynamic Recursive Information Space (SDRIS).**

## Overview
This repository collects source code, visualizations, and datasets used to verify the mathematical and physical postulates of SDRIS. The focus lies on p-adic hydrodynamics, topological stability, and recursive information processing.

## Projects

### [1. Geometric Tunneling & p-adic Hydrodynamics](./01_Geometric_Tunneling)
Numerical verification of the **Topological Throttle** mechanism. This simulation demonstrates how hyper-dissipative p-adic operators ($\alpha > 1.5$) prevent finite-time singularities by enforcing a discrete, staircase-like energy transport (tunneling) instead of continuous flow.
* **Status:** Published
* **Associated Paper:** *Geometric Tunneling and Topological Stability: A Reinterpretation of p-adic Hydrodynamics*

### 2. Black Hole Information Resolution (Upcoming)
Modeling event horizons as topological phase transitions where $\alpha$ drops below the critical stability threshold.
